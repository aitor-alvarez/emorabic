### The number of audios per term can be specified.

- from the commadline, type:

```python3 main.py --max-results 10 --duration 60```

- The default duration of the audio is 60 seconds as the argument above shows.
- I noticed that we need to increase the number of `--max-results` to get the desired duration. In other words, it is not easy to get durations less than 30 seconds.
